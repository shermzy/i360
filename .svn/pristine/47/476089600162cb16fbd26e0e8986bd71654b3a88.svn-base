The menu at left appears and acts very much like the Explorer menu on Windows
machines. Clicking on an item loads an associated link. Clicking on a folder
will also toggle it open or close it, revealing or hiding a submenu. To close
all the folders, you can click on the root at top.
<p>
Some of the features:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Any number of items may be defined for a menu and folders can be nested
  arbitrarily deep.
  <li>The selected item or folder is highlighted when clicked.
  <li>The page will automatically scroll to place the selected item in view.
  <li>Folders may optionally include a link.
  <li>The menu state is saved so when a visitor leaves and returns to your
  page, the menu will appear exactly as it did when last viewed.
  <li>You can customize the page colors, fonts and graphics to suite your needs.
</ul>
<p>
<font color="#cc6600"><b>Using the Script</b></font>
<p>
This section describes how to set up and create your own tree menu.
<p>
<b>Files</b>
<p>
The main file defines the frameset and contains all the code. Below is a list
of all the files used and their purpose:
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>tree.html</b> - defines the left and right frames and imports the
  JavaScript code.
  <li><b>treeMenuCode.js</b> - Contains all the JavaScript code needed to
  build and display the menu and save it's state.
  <li><b>myMenu.js</b> - Defines this particular tree menu.
  <li><b>treeMenu.html</b> - Initially a blank page which is rebuilt
  dynamically to display the menu whenever an item is clicked on.
  <li><b>treeMain.html</b> - This page.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Setting Up the Menu</b>
<p>
To create your menu, you need to build your own version of <b>myMenu.js.</b>
Before you start defining the menu itself, you need to set some global
variables:
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>treeMenu</b> - This is the top-level menu. See below on how to create
  this.
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuName</b> - This should be set to some string which will be
  used to uniquely identify this particular menu. It's used as the name of the
  cookie which will store the menu state. If you update your menu, change the
  name so the data will be recreated from scratch to match the new
  configuration.
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuDays</b> - This value is used to set the expiration date for
  the menu cookie. Use an integer to specify the number of days the cookie will
  be valid for. If the user doesn't return to your page before then, the cookie
  expires and the menu state is reset to where all folders are closed and no
  item is selected.
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuFrame</b> - Set this to the name of the frame that will
  contain the menu.
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuImgDir</b> - Specifies the path to the menu and icon images.
  For example, if you put the images in a sub-directory called "graphics" set
  this to "graphics/". If the images are in the same directory, set this to a
  null string ("").
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuBackground</b> - URL of an image to use for the menu frame
  background. Set to a null string ("") if you don't want a background image.
  Note that <b>treeMenuImgDir</b> is not used for the image, you should
  specify the same URL you would use in a &lt;BODY&gt; tag.
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuBgColor, treeMenuFgColor,treeMenuHiBg, treeMenuHiFg</b> -
  color values used for the menu frame background, item text and selected item
  background and text respectively. Standard RGB color values or color names
  may be used, e.g. "#ffffff" or "white".
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuFont, treeMenuFontSize</b> - These values will be used for the
  face and size paramters of the &lt;font&gt; tag for menu text. The menu at
  left uses "MS Sans Serif,Arial,Helvetica" with a size of "1".
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuRoot</b> - This is the text that will be used for the menu
  root. Here it's set to "Site Menu".
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuFolders</b> - Controls the display of the '+' and '-' icons
  next to folders. If set to 1, the icon will always appear next to a folder.
  When set to 0 the icon will only appear next to folders that contain one or
  more sub-folders. Setting this to -1 means the icons will never appear.
  <p>
  <li><b>treeMenuAltText</b> - May be true or false. If set to true, images for
  the menu icons will use the item text for the ALT parameter. Most current
  browsers will display this as a tool tip when the icon is moused over. This
  can be useful when the item text extends past the edge of menu frame.
</ul>
<p>
Note that all the above variables should be defined and set with a value.
There are no defaults so leaving any out may cause the menu to fail. Here's a
look at the values used for the menu at left:
<p>
<pre>
var treeMenu = new TreeMenu();
var treeMenuName = "myMenu_1.0";
var treeMenuDays = 7;
var treeMenuFrame = "menuFrame";
var treeMenuImgDir = "graphics/";
var treeMenuBackground = "";
var treeMenuBgColor = "#ffffff";
var treeMenuFgColor = "#000000";
var treeMenuHiBg = "#008080";
var treeMenuHiFg = "#ffffff";
var treeMenuFont = "MS Sans Serif,Arial,Helvetica";
var treeMenuFontSize   = 1;
var treeMenuRoot = "Site Menu";
var treeMenuFolders = 0;
var treeMenuAltText = true;
</pre>
<p>
<b>Defining the Menu</b>
<p>
The file <b>treeMenuCode.js</b> defines two new JavaScript objects,
<b>TreeMenu</b> and <b>TreeMenuItem</b> along with some methods to add an item
to a menu or to make an item a submenu.
<p>
First, define the top-level menu using the <b>treeMenu</b> global variable:
<p>
<pre>
var treeMenu = new TreeMenu();
</pre>
<p>
Now create some items for it by defining some <b>TreeMenuItem()</b> objects.
You specify one to four arguments for an item. The first is the text used in
the menu display. The rest apply to the link for the item. They are:
<ul>
  <li><b>text</b> the text for the menu item.
  <li><b>url</b> (optional) the URL address for a link.
  <li><b>target</b> (optional) the name of the target window or frame for the
  link.
  <li><b>icon</b> (optional) the icon to use in the menu display if this is not
  a folder.
</ul>
<p>
Then you use the <b>addItem</b> method to attach an item to a menu. Here is the
code to define and add the main menu items:
<p>
<pre>
treeMenu.addItem(new TreeMenuItem("Active Server Pages"));
treeMenu.addItem(new TreeMenuItem("Dynamic HTML"));
treeMenu.addItem(new TreeMenuItem("Java"));
treeMenu.addItem(new TreeMenuItem("JavaScript"));
treeMenu.addItem(new TreeMenuItem("About This Site",
  "/about.html", "_blank"));
treeMenu.addItem(new TreeMenuItem("Contact Brain Jar",
   "/contact.asp", "_blank"));
treeMenu.addItem(new TreeMenuItem("What's New",
   "/new.html", "_blank"));
</pre>
<p>
Note that the items will be displayed in the order they are added. The first
three items here will be submenus, so only the text is given (you could define
a link for them as well, but in this case we won't). For links you can leave
off the icon value if you wish to use the default images.
<p>
We can then reference each item in this menu using the <b>.items</b> array,
where <i>treeMenu.items[0]</i> is 'Active Server Pages',
<i>treeMenu.items[1]</i> is 'Dynamic HTML', etc.
<p>
<b>Defining and Attaching Submenus</b>
<p>
We create submenus just like the main menu, using new variables. Here we'll
create the 'Active Server Pages' submenu:
<p>
<pre>
var asp = new TreeMenu();
asp.addItem(new TreeMenuItem("Code Examples"));
asp.addItem(new TreeMenuItem("Sites"));
</pre>
<p>
Now, to attach this submenu to the main menu, we first reference the main menu
item we want to attach it to and use <b>.makeSubmenu()</b> passing the submenu
variable as the argument:
<p>
<pre>
treeMenu.items[0].makeSubmenu(asp);
</pre>
<p>
This makes the first item in <i>treeMenu</i> a submenu which contains all the
items defined in <i>asp.</i>
<p>
Each of the items on the 'asp' submenu is also a submenu so for each we
create a new <b>TreeMenu</b>, add items to it and then attach it to the
appropriate item in the <i>asp</i> submenu.
<p>
<pre>
// Define ASP code examples submenu and
// attach to first item of ASP submenu.

var asp_ex = new TreeMenu();
asp_ex.addItem(...);
asp_ex.addItem(...);
...
asp.items[0].makeSubmenu(asp_ex);

// Define ASP sites submenu and attach
// to second item of ASP submenu.

var asp_sites = new TreeMenu();
asp_sites.addItem(...);
asp_sites.addItem(...);
...
asp.items[2].makeSubmenu(asp_sites);
</pre>
<p>
The creation of the DHTML submenus is similar.
<p>
Now for the 'Java Applets' submenu we add some items and attach it to the main
menu. It has no submenus of it's own so this is all we need to do with it.
<p>
<pre>
var java = new TreeMenu();
java.addItem(...);
java.addItem(...);

...

// Attach to second item of main menu.

treeMenu.items[1].makeSubmenu(java);
</pre>
<p>
The 'JavaScript' submenu is also similar to the 'Active Server Pages' and
'DHTML' submenus so there's no need to repeat the code here.
<p>
For your own menus, you can define as many items as you want in each menu and
you can nest submenus as deep as you want.
<p>
You can also change the graphics and icons used for each of the menu parts,
see the list of images at the bottom of the page.
<p>
<font color="#cc6600"><b>How it Works</b></font>
<p>
Much of the code has been streamlined from the previous version. I've also
changed the global variable and function names to begin with 'treeMenu' so that
it won't interfere with any other JavaScript code you may add.
<p>
<b>The TreeMenu and TreeMenuItem Objects</b>
<p>
These are the the key to setting up and displaying the menu. The
<b>TreeMenu</b> object consists simply of an array to store the items and a
method to add them.
<p>
The <b>TreeMenuItem</b> object contains variables to store the item's display
text, icon image source (if specified) and data for it's associated link
(if any). It also has a pointer which can be set to a <b>TreeMenu</b> object
if it is to be a folder. The <b>makeSubmenu()</b> method is used to assign this
pointer. It also has an index variable which relates it to the proper value in
the menu state cookie (see below) so we can track which folder items are open
and which are closed.
<p>
Using these, the menu is built when the top-level page is first loaded,
creating a hierarchical structure in the global <b>treeMenu</b> variable.
<p>
<b>Menu State Data</b>
<p>
One cookie is used to track which folders in the menu are open and which are
closed. Every item has a boolean value associated with it in this cookie. The
values are read in just before the menu is drawn and the values are updated
every time the user clicks on an item.
<p>
A separate cookie is used to keep track of which item was last clicked,
allowing it to be highlighted when drawn. It is also used to determine how far
the window needs to be scrolled if that item falls outside of the menu frame's
viewable region.
<p>
Note that if you update your menu, you should also change the value of
<b>treeMenuName</b> so that new cookies will be created from scratch and the
old cookie values won't conflict with the new menu structure.
<p>
If the user's browser does not support cookies, or if they have been disabled,
the menu state will be lost when the user exits the page.
<p>
<b>Drawing the Menu</b>
<p>
The file <b>treeMenu.html</b> uses the <b>onload</b> event in the &lt;body&gt;
tag to call the <b>treeMenuDisplay()</b> function located in the parent file.
This function rewrites HTML code of the menu frame to build the menu display
based on the current menu state. This new HTML also includes an <b>onload</b>
call to run the <b>treeMenuScroll()</b> function, which will scroll the page
if necessary for the selected item to be in view.
<p>
<b>treeMenuDisplay()</b> works as follows. First, it fetches the cookie data so
we will know which folders are to be open and which item was selected last.
Then some global variables are set to track where we are in the menu hierarchy
and help with the graphics placement.
<p>
Then the menu frame document is cleared using the <b>document.open()</b>
method. This allows it to completely rewrite the HTML code of the frame. It
generates the proper HTML tags to define style sheets and set the page colors
and background, if any. It also adds a call to <b>treeMenuScroll()</b> in the
<b>onload</b> event of the body tag.
<p>
Then, we start the display with a &lt;table&gt; tag. The first row just
contains the root icon and text. Each following row will contain a menu item.
<p>
Here, the recursive nature of the tree menu objects is what makes the display
drawing work. We make a call to <b>treeMenuListItems()</b> passing it the top
level menu (the <b>treeMenu</b> variable). When it returns, all the items will
have been drawn and we just finish with the closing &lt;/table&gt; tag.
<p>
<b>treeMenuListItems()</b> is very simple, it just takes the given menu and
loops thru each item making a call to <b>treeMenuDisplayItem()</b> to write it
out. It also passes a flag to indicate whether the item being passed is the
last one in the menu or not so the proper 'tee' or 'corner' graphic can be
used.
<p>
<b>treeMenuDisplayItem()</b> is the workhorse. It writes out the proper images
and text for the given item as a table row. Some global variables are used to
track how far to indent the item and what images are needed to create the tree
layout. Then, based on the properties of the menu item, it displays the proper
icon (folder, file icon, custom icon, etc.) and it's text.
<p>
If an item happens to be a submenu it checks the cookie data to determine if it
should be expanded or not. If so, it makes a recursive call to
<b>treeMenuListItems()</b> passing it the item's submenu.
<p>
In this function, we also update the global scrolling values if the given item
is the selected one.
<p>
Once the menu is finally drawn, some closing tags are output and the menu frame
will now reflect the proper menu view.
<p>
<b>Making the Menu Interactive</b>
<p>
Each item is written as a hypertext link with a call to <b>treeMenuClick()</b>
that will cause a redisplay of the menu if the item is clicked. The function is
passed the item's index value, so we can update the cookie data and a couple
of boolean flags letting it know if the item links to another page and if it is
a folder.
<p>
The function updates the cookie values, toggling the folder open or closed if
it's a submenu and marking the item as the selected one. It then makes a call
to <b>treeMenuDisplay()</b> which results in an updated display of the menu.
<p>
For the menu root, we call <b>treeMenuRootClick()</b> instead which simply
deletes the cookies and redraws the menu frame. This causes it to start with
all folders closed and no item selected.
<p>
